# Runloop API Client Takehome Assignment

Thank you for taking the time to take this assessment. This is intended to test how quickly you can learn a new framework, your understanding of Runloop/container primitives, and finally give you a sense of what work might look like when using our product. 

You objective is to complete as many of the following tasks, as correctly as possible. Task #3 is an extension and it directly mirrors what everyday work onboarding benchmarks will feel like.

We will grade this assignment for completion > code quality and organization = speed (based on final commit timestamp). You will be contacted at your email for any follow-up actions.

## Setup
Sign-up @ [platform.runloop.ai](https://platform.runloop.ai) for the **Pro plan** with your credit card. You given credits and your card will not be charged during this process. Generate an api key for this project.

SDK setup (Pointing to our development servers)
```python
from runloop_api_client import Runloop

client = Runloop(bearer_token=os.environ.get("RUNLOOP_API_KEY"))
```

```typescript
import { Runloop } from "@runloop/api-client";
e
const client = new Runloop({
  bearerToken: process.env.RUNLOOP_API_KEY,
});
```

## Tasks

For each task, make a separate script that completes the stated task. Organize your project however you wish, but please keep in mind standard software engineering convention and best practices.

### 1.a Create Devbox
- Use Runloop SDK (Python or TypeScript) to create a devbox
    - https://github.com/runloopai/runloop-examples
- Name it your email address
- Record `api-key`, `devbox-name`, and `devbox-id` in `answers.json`

### 1.b Operations on the devbox
- Copy the provided `resources` folder into the new devbox
- Edit `me.txt` and replace the email with your own
- Execute either `test.js` or `test.py` on the devbox

### 1.c Create snapshot
- Snapshot your devbox after step 2
- Record `snapshot-id` in `answers.json`

### 2. Create blueprint
- Make a blueprint
  - Install `cowsay` in the blueprint
  - Create and save `blueprint-name` and `blueprint-id` to `answers.json`
  - Boot a devbox from the created blueprint and save a screenshot of `cowsay` running
  - Commit the screenshot as `blueprint.png`
  - Record `blueprint-name` and `blueprint-id` in `answers.json`
  
### 3. Extension - Create a Custom Scenario via API
- Make a scenario with a custom scorer that checks for the presence of `resources`
  - Copy scenario folder `resources` to devbox
  - Custom Scorer (Can be any type they want)
    - returns 1 if folder and files exist
    - returns 0 if not
  - Run scenario, creating a scenario run
  - Execute the script from step 1.b to load edit `me.txt` and one of the test scripts
  - Score and complete the scenario run
  - Record `ext-scenario-run-id` in `answers.json`
